## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of all the **Node.js** concepts and projects I have explored. It includes explanations, code snippets, and small projects that demonstrate basic to intermediate knowledge of **Node.js**.

## Concepts Covered

### Basic Concepts
- Setting up a Node.js environment
- Understanding the Event Loop
- Working with **modules** (CommonJS, ES Modules)
- File System (FS) module: Reading and writing files
- Working with Buffers, Streams, and Events
- HTTP module: Creating a simple web server
- Handling asynchronous operations (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)
- NPM basics: Working with packages and dependencies

### Intermediate Concepts
- Building RESTful APIs with Node.js (without frameworks)
- Middleware basics
- Error handling and debugging
- Working with external APIs
- File uploads using `Multer`
- Introduction to databases (MongoDB, SQL) and connecting with Node.js
- Working with `Express.js` as a lightweight framework

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: Core runtime environment for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Used in some projects for routing and middleware.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage in some applications.
- **Multer**: For handling file uploads in Node.js applications.
- **Fetch**: For making HTTP requests to external APIs.
